# Ethics manifesto 



## My Ethical Principles

My data ethics follow the theme of data transperancy. This idea stems mainly from Facebook Files that we listened to in class. I believe that when data and any analyses done with data reveal insights that could potentially help society or a subpopulation it is the responsibility of the company or business to inform the piblic. With this same theme, data gathering should be transperant whether on a website or any other physical business. Consumers should know how much of their data is being gathered and what it is being used for. Along this same line, terms and conditions statemnets on websites should be readable for normal people that have no training or knowledge of law or data.
